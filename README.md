This project investigates the emotional, physical, and social health outcomes of caregivers for individuals with dementia, with a focus on racial and ethnic disparities. Using data from the National Survey of Older Americans Act Participants (NSOAAP) for 2021 and 2022, the analysis aims to identify differences in health outcomes based on caregivers' self-described race/ethnicity and understand the factors influencing these disparities.
